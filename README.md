# Data-Analysis-with-Tableau
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics with Tableau
# About
My role: To identify the factors contributing to employee churn and provide actionable insights.
Project description: The dataset includes information about employees in the company. It contains various attributes such as the employee's age, gender, job role, education, department, and marital status.
# Purpose and Approach
- I started with data cleaning to ensure accurate analysis. 
- This included removing any duplicate entries to avoid potential biases in the dataset.
- Then I created an HR analytics dashboard that presents key insights on employee attrition.
- The analytics dashboard created using Power BI is a powerful tool for making informed decisions about employee attrition.
