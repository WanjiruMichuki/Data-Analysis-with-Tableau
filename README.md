# Data-Analysis-with-Tableau
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics with Tableau
# About
My role: To identify the Covid Cases by Country and provide actionable insights.
Project description: The dataset includes information about COVID-19 cases by Country. It contains various attributes such as the victim's age, gender, and marital status.
# Purpose and Approach
- I started with data cleaning to ensure accurate analysis. 
- This included removing any duplicate entries to avoid potential biases in the dataset.
- Then I created an HR analytics dashboard that presents key insights on employee attrition.
- The analytics dashboard created using Power BI is a powerful tool for making informed decisions about COVID-19 case attrition.
